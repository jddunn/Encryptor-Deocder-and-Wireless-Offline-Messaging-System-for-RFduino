This program contains an encryptor / decoder that uses a randomly generated multi-step Ceaser algorithim every time it is run. 
There is also the framework for a wireless, offline messaging system using RFduinos that has not been tested yet. With two computers (Raspberry pi compatible) with RFduinos connected through USB running this program, passwords will be sent out as serial data to be picked up by any RFduino within range. If the right password is found by both users, then they are connected, and can begin messaging each other, only sending out the encrypted data through serial that is to be decoded locally given the cipher key randomly generated every instance.
